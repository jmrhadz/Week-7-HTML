    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <img src="images\profilepic.jpg" alt="a long-haired man and a beautiful woman in formal attire smiling"></img>
    <p>We make functional and decorational pottery, ceramic art and watercolor paintings of places and scenes.<br>
        While Kate is a full-time art teacher and John Mark is trying to break into the tech industry,<br>
        they spend much of their free time throwing pots in their garage-turned-studio or painting and drawing at local cafes.<br>
        Kate and John Mark met in college in Springfield, Missouri, where they were taking art classes.<br>
        In their first year of marriage, they moved to Japan on a whim and got into the habit of drawing almost every day.
